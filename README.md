A short description of the project:
- This is the group repo for [02476 Machine Learning Operation](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02476) Jan. 2022. 
- Course [Home page](https://skaftenicki.github.io/dtu_mlops/)
- FrameWork [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) 
- To get setup with both code and data by simply running:
    - `git clone https://github.com/AbdulstarKousa/Project-MLOps-2022.git`
    - `dvc pull`

In this project we make use of the [Hugging Face Transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers) framework to create a binary sentiment classifier for review’s given to highly polarized movies on [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com).
The dataset is available on the [Hugging Face Github](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/tree/master/datasets/imdb) page.

The model used for performing the classification is a **Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers** also known as [**BERT**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805).
Transfer learning will be applied by training a pre-trained model on 25.000 positive/negative labeled movie reviews, and then evaluated on another 25.000 reviews.
Different configurations of BERT will be trained and evaluated.

The whole pipeline is also available as a Docker-Image:
